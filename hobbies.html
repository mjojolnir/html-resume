  <h3><li>Exercising</li></h3>
  <p>
    I like going for a walk, an easy run, hitting the weights, just overall
    sporty stuffs. It makes my mind relaxed and just gives tons of benefits for
    the body.

  <h3><li>Listening to Music</li></h3>
  <p>
    Whenever I'm bored, or showeirng, I always play music around. It keeps me
    motivated, or in the mood depends on my activites. I almost use Spotify
    everytime I listen to music.

  <h3><li>Watching A Movie in the Cinema</li></h3>
  <p>
    I also like watching a movie in the cinema. It helps me entertained and just
    relaxed when I sit down and watch some movie. I like romcoms and overall
    American movies. They are just so damn cool.
